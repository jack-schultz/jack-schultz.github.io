                        <p>
                            I joined the Robotics Club early in my second year at PAC and 3D modeled our team's designs and wrote the code to control it.
                            During my second year i became a team leader. I organised which members of my team were to complete which tasks and married each part together.
                            In my last year of Secondary school, i returned as a mentor due to more limited free time from academics. I taught students how to problem solv using 3D modling softwars like inventor and audocad. Furthermore i assisted in teaching electronics and wiring robots together.

                        <h3>Clarnette Family Ethics Prize - 2023</h3>
                        <!--  <img src="images/tetris.png" alt="Screenshot of Tetris game"> -->
                        <p>
                            I was honoured to receive this annual prize in recognition of my outstanding contribution to
                            the ethical awareness of the College community. The award highlights my ability to apply
                            ethical analysis and demonstrate ethical leadership, advocacy, and service, both on
                            campus and within the broader community. This recognition was especially meaningful because
                            it was voted on by the College’s teachers, reflecting the trust and respect I’ve earned
                            from academic professionals.

                            This achievement is significant because it provides evidence of my ability to:

                        <ul>
                            Demonstrate Ethical Leadership: By consistently acting with integrity and
                            promoting ethical standards, I contributed to creating a more thoughtful, conscientious
                            community. This is an important skill in any professional setting, as ethical leadership
                            underpins effective decision-making and fosters a culture of trust.
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            Engage in Ethical Analysis: I have shown strong critical thinking skills in
                            addressing complex ethical dilemmas. This ability to analyse situations from a moral perspective
                            is crucial in identifying the right course of action, especially in roles that require
                            accountability, compliance, and social responsibility.
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            Influence and Inspire Others: Through advocacy and service, I’ve played an
                            active role in encouraging others to reflect on ethical issues and improve their conduct.
                            This ability to inspire and guide people towards better choices is an asset in leadership or
                            team-based roles.
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            Build Trust and Respect: Being selected by my teachers for this award speaks
                            to the consistent and positive impression I’ve made, further validating my commitment to ethical
                            principles.
