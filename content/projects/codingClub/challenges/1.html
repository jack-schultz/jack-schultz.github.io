<h1>Managing Different Skill Levels</h1>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>
Students joined with vastly different levels of experience. Some had never written code before, while others already had strong foundations. This made it difficult to keep lessons engaging and useful for everyone.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
I structured lessons with core concepts that everyone could follow, along with optional extension exercises for more advanced students. I also provided individual guidance during sessions to help students progress at their own pace.
</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
This approach allowed beginners to build confidence without feeling overwhelmed, while advanced students remained engaged and continued improving.
</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
I developed the ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and adapt explanations based on the audience’s level of understanding.
