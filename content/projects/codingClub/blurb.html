    <h2>Coding Club Instructor</h2>
    <p>
        I founded and now run a coding club at my former high school, where I teach programming to
        students with varying experience levels. What began as a volunteer initiative became a paid
        position due to its success and continued demand. I design lesson plans, create original
        teaching materials, and guide students through programming fundamentals while coordinating
        sessions with school staff. The club focuses on developing problem-solving skills, logical
        thinking, and confidence in programming.
