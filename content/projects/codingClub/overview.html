<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I founded and now run a coding club at my former high school, where I teach programming to students of varying experience levels. What began as a volunteer initiative in my final years of school later became a paid position due to its success and continued demand.

My responsibilities include designing lesson plans, teaching programming concepts, creating original learning materials, and coordinating sessions with school staff. The goal of the club is to help students develop problem-solving skills and build confidence in programming.
