<h2>Tech & Skills Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Python & discord.py</strong> –
        Designed and implemented an event-driven system handling voice state
        updates, channel lifecycle management, and Discord API integration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SQLite</strong> –
        Implemented persistent data storage to maintain system state across
        crashes and restarts, including automatic schema updates and
        forward-compatible migrations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Database Architecture</strong> –
        Created a database abstraction layer to separate persistence logic from
        business logic, improving maintainability, extensibility, and code clarity.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Asynchronous Programming</strong> –
        Managed concurrent Discord events safely, implementing synchronization
        logic to prevent race conditions and ensure consistent system state.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fault-Tolerant System Design</strong> –
        Built recovery-safe logic to prevent orphaned channels and ensure reliable
        operation during rapid user interactions, disconnects, and restarts.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong> –
        Structured the bot around Discord’s real-time event system, enabling
        scalable and responsive handling of channel creation, deletion, and
        user interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interactive UI Systems</strong> –
        Developed persistent control panels using interactive components, allowing
        users to dynamically configure channel permissions and settings.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Linux Deployment & Systemd</strong> –
        Deployed and managed the bot as a system service on a self-hosted Linux
        server, ensuring automatic startup and crash recovery. Later migrated to
        enterprise hosting solution to mitigate residential network and power outages.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Version Control & Open Source Practices</strong> –
        Used Git and GitHub for version control, structured commits, documentation,
        and iterative feature development.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Production Debugging & Reliability</strong> –
        Diagnosed and resolved real-world issues including race conditions,
        stale state, and edge cases arising from asynchronous event timing.
    </li>
