<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Automatic Channel Creation & Cleanup</strong> <br>
        Channels are created when needed and automatically deleted
        when empty, reducing channel bloat and keeping the server
        clean.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User-Controlled Permissions</strong> <br>
        Users can lock their temporary channels, hide them from others,
        or create personalised access lists (whitelist/blacklist), all
        from a persistent control panel.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Persistent Interface</strong> <br>
        Each channel has an associated text panel with buttons and live
        information, helping users understand and manage their voice
        channel with ease. No commands needed.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Crash-Resistant State Management</strong> <br>
        Channel data is saved to a local database (SQLite), ensuring the
        bot can recover and clean up correctly even after restarts or crashes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Built for Real Use</strong> <br>
        The bot was designed to run 24/7, respond to rapid user activity,
        and operate reliably even in high-turnover environments with
        multiple overlapping events.
