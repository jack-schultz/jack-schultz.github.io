    <h1>Displaying Information to Users</h1>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
        In previous projects, I implemented many commands that displayed information
        to users. However, this approach often left users uncertain about their permissions
        and capabilities within their voice channels, as well as unsure how to use the bot
        effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
        To address this, I created a persistent message in each channel’s associated text channel.
        This message provided real-time system state visibility and direct user control over channel configuration.
        This approach provided users
        with immediate, clear feedback on what actions they could take and how to control their
        channels. This worked well for basic management and was a more dynamic and intuitive for advanced control
        like locking or hiding channels, as well as managing a whitelist and blacklist for specific users or roles from accessing the user's channel.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The result was a clear, user-friendly interface that gave channel owners greater control
        over who can view or use their temporary voice channels. This improved user experience
        and reduced confusion by making permissions and channel status instantly visible and
        easily adjustable.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        The method used to communicate functionality to users was a key aspect of this project.
        By creating a persistent control interface using interactive components in the associated text channel, I was able to provide
        users with immediate feedback on what actions they could take and how to control their
        channels. This approach not only improved the user experience but also provided a more
        dynamic and intuitive way to manage multiple features with complex interactions.
