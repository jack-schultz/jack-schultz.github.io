<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi, I'm <strong>MeltedButter</strong>, well that's my online pseudonym. I live near <a href="{{mapURL}}" target=”_blank”>Adelaide, Australia</a>,
    I am a student and aspiring software developer with a strong passion for learning.
    Since 2021, I've built a range of
    personal projects utilising Python, C++ and JavaScript. Almost all of my experience was self-taught until beginning a
    Bachelor of Computer Science degree in 2026.
</p>
<p>
    I've coded Discord bots, run my own home server, mentored high school students
    in both <strong>robotics and problem-solving using python</strong>. I continue to enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into functioning technology,
    most notable of which is my <a href="{{discordBotURL}}">Discord Bot</a> now <strong>servicing over {{discordBotUserCount}} users</strong>.
