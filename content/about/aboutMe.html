<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi, I'm <strong>Jack Schultz</strong>. As a teenager, I used the online pseudonym
    "MeltedButter," but I have since transitioned to using my name publicly. I live
    near <a href="{{mapURL}}" target=”_blank”>Adelaide, Australia</a>, I am a student
    at Adelaide University and am an aspiring software developer with a strong passion
    for learning. Since 2021, I've built a range of personal projects utilising Python,
    C++ and JavaScript. Almost all of my experience was self-taught before beginning a
    Bachelor of Computer Science degree in 2026.

<p>
    I've coded Discord bots, run my own home server, mentored high school students
    in both <strong>robotics and problem-solving using python</strong>. I continue to enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into functioning technology,
    most notable of which is my <a href="{{discordBotURL}}">Discord Bot</a> now <strong>servicing over {{discordBotUserCount}} users</strong>.
